No, this version won't hit rate limits. The rate limit issue was caused by the `thinking=True` parameter in the typing indicator implementation, which Discord rate limits aggressively.

This rollback version:
- Uses standard `defer()` without `thinking=True`
- Maintains all `additional_messages` functionality 
- Removes the rate-limited typing indicator feature

You're safe to deploy this version - it's the stable code with additional messages support but without the problematic typing indicator.
